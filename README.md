# 🤖 Hybrid AI Chatbot

🚀 Just wrapped up building a **Hybrid AI Chatbot** that combines structured data search with **LLM-powered** responses!  
This project blends **structured knowledge retrieval** with **generative AI** for fast, accurate, and human-like answers.

---

## 💡 Highlights

- **Dual Approach**:  
  1. Retrieves exact answers from a **CSV knowledge base** using **Pandas**.  
  2. If no match is found, generates contextual responses using **Orca Mini v3 7B** via **Hugging Face**.
  
- **Performance**:  
  Optimized with **PyTorch** + **GPU acceleration** for real-time responses.

- **Scalability**:  
  Easily extendable to new datasets, domains, or LLMs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Data Handling:** Pandas  
- **Model Serving:** PyTorch  
- **NLP/LLM:** Hugging Face Transformers, Orca Mini v3 7B  
- **Concepts:** Hybrid Search, Knowledge Retrieval, Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## 🔍 How It Works

 1. Structured Search:

- Uses Pandas to search knowledge_base.csv for relevant answers.

- Returns the exact response instantly if found.

 2. Fallback to LLM:

- If no match in CSV, passes the user query to Orca Mini v3 7B via Hugging Face Transformers.

- Generates a conversational, human-like response.

 3. Hybrid Response Logic:

- Ensures factual precision where available and creative, context-aware replies otherwise.

## 💼 About Me
